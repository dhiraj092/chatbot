IDEATE-
The ideate phase utilizes Crazy Eights, Lotus Blossom, and 6-3-5 to generate a wide range of potential solutions, prioritizing quantity over quality initially. These tools provide structured approaches to creative brainstorming:

Crazy Eights Tool:
The Crazy Eights tool is a fast-paced brainstorming exercise designed to unleash creativity by challenging you to generate 8 ideas in 8 minutes. 
This technique prioritizes quantity over quality, encouraging quick thinking and preventing the filtering out of "bad ideas." It's an excellent way to push boundaries and explore a wide range of possibilities. The rapid pace keeps you on your toes and fosters an environment where wild, unconventional ideas can emerge and thrive.
https://www.innovationhubslc.ca/tools/crazy-eights

Lotus Blossom Tool:
The Lotus Blossom tool is a structured brainstorming technique designed to explore ideas in depth by breaking them down into sub-themes around a central concept. This method encourages detailed thinking and the expansion of initial ideas into more refined and actionable insights. 
In the Lotus Blossom exercise, the central theme or problem is placed in the middle of the central grid. Surrounding this central theme, fill in related ideas or sub-themes. Each sub-theme then becomes the centre of its own Lotus Blossom, further breaking down into more specific ideas. This iterative process helps uncover deeper insights and innovative solutions.

EVALUATE/PRIORITIZE-
Before moving into prototyping, teams use the Control Impact Matrix, Pugh Matrix, Value Proposition, and Prioritree to assess and prioritize their ideas to identify the most promising solutions. These evaluation tools help teams make informed decisions based on impact, feasibility, and value:

Control Impact Matrix Tool:
The Control Impact Matrix is a tool designed to help teams or groups evaluate and prioritize ideas. This matrix provides a structured framework for assessing the potential impact and level of control you have over each idea in relation to the problem being addressed.
Using the Strategic Impact Matrix, participants can categorize ideas into different quadrants, such as "High Impact, Easy to Control" or "Low Impact, Hard to Control" allowing them to focus their efforts on ideas that are most likely to contribute to a meaningful solution.
